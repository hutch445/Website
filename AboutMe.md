# About Me

![Me](./images/Me.jpg.jpg)

Hi! I'm Ty Hutchison a current Freshman at Quinnipiac University, I am majoring in Computer Science and will graduate in 2024. My highschool, Tatnall, is located in Wilmington, Delaware, while my middle school, Upland Country Day School, was located in Pennsylvania. I love hockey, I have played since I was 3 years old, and played at a very high level of youth Hockey. Unfortunately I decided to cut ties with playing in pursuit of education, and that's how I ended up here.
